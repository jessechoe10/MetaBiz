# MetaBiz
I created a website where people can find articles related to business and finance. They can query their prompts in the search bar and get the results from Metaphor's API. I used HTML, JavaScript, Flask, particles.js, Three.js, and Tailwind for my website.

# How to run
Run python app.py and open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the frontend.
